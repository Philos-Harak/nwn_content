Philos' Philos Enhancing Player System and AI for single player  
04.13.2025 

This is the readme document for Philos' PEPS and AI compatibility.  
It goes over the features that will work in a specific module. 

There are two types of compatibility that my mod can achieve. 

1. Patch and Override compatibility: This means the mod will work with the module by using the Patch method or 
the Override method. 

2. Development compatibility: This means either some or all of the features will require using the development 
folder to override the scripts required for all of the mod to work. 
Each module’s file has been separated into unique folders named after the module. You can either just copy the files 
from the module you are playing into the development folder or you can copy them all if you want to have all the 
compatibility setup. Note the files in each folder are the same and you can overwrite them and they will all still work. 

!!!!!WARNING!!!!! 
Using the development folder for modification of your game is not recommended unless you know exactly what you 
are doing. If you are having in game issues and you are using mods in your development folder DO NOT ASK the 
developers of the game to help. The first thing they will tell you is to remove everything from your development and 
override folders.  
Now that you have been informed below is a list of modules that are either compatible, not compatible, or need 
testing.
