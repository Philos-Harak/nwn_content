This is a quick guide on how to setup a server to use the monster AI.


The AI uses the following Event scripts with obvious names. 
OnBlocked          - 0e_c2_e_blocked
OnCombatRoundEnd   - 0e_c2_3_endround
OnConversation     - 0e_c2_4_convers
OnDamaged          - 0e_c2_6_damaged
OnDeath            - AI doesn't use.
OnDisturbed        - 0e_c2_8_disturbed
OnHeartbeat        - 0e_c2_1_hb
OnPerception       - 0e_c2_2_percept
OnPhysicalAttacked - 0e_c2_5_phyatked
OnRested           - AI doesn't use.
OnSpawn            - 0e_c2_9_onspawn
OnSpellCastAt      - 0e_c2_b_castat
OnUserDefined      - AI doesn't use.

* Make a backup before you start!
* Renaming these scripts to the events of your monsters is the easiest way to add in the basic monster AI.
* You can also test via the Development folder or add to your module.
* Add the ai_spells.2da file to the override,development folder, or a hak.

Naming conventions to help understand the systems:
0e_ - is an executable script via an event.
0i_ - is an include script.
ai_ - is an AI script that will be called each combat round to determine the creatures actions.
inc_sqlite_time - an include file used for combat time.
