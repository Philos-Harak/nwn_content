*********************************
********** Description **********
*********************************
This system will add a whole new suite of menus and options for players and dungeon masters as well as an updated AI for monsters and associates.
This zip holds the text (nss) version of the files (folder: module) with the 2da files needed to use as well as an override version if you don't want to add it to your module.

******************************
********** Features **********
******************************
There are too many options to list here. 
Please see the Philos AI for Servers.pdf file for how to use the DM systems and the Philos AI for players.pdf to see how all the options work for players.

**********************************
********** Installation **********
**********************************
* Must be running version v89.8193.37-15 of the game.

* ai_spells.2da should be in a hak or the override folder of the server. If the scripts cannot find this 2da THEY WILL NOT WORK. 
     ai_spells.2da allows the talent system to categorize a creatures spells so it can cast effectively. 
     It is also used to decide which creatures should be targeted based on immunities, saves, and resistances. 
     It also defines how a monster can prebuff. VERY IMPORTANT for the AI!
     If you have new spells or abilities these can be added to the ai_spells.2da just like any spell is added to the spells.2da 
         See Philos AI for Servers.pdf for instructions on how to update.
* Depending on your setup there are three ways to install Philos' AI to work with your server.

********** Method #1 **********
This method requires that you are using the default Bioware AI scripts and have not changed anything in those AI scripts.
  How to install:
  a) Place all of the files in the module folder of this zip into your server's module folder.
  b) If you have not changed any of the default AI scripts this should NOT replace any files when adding my files to the module.
      If some files require to overwrite when being copied then you should use method #2.
  f) Place the prc_peps.hak into the hak order of the module.
  d) Either place 0e_onclientload in the OnClientEnter event or add the code from this script to your OnClientEnter script.
  e) Compile your module and test.

********** Method #2 **********
This method is used if you are using either a downloaded AI or have changed some or all of the AI scripts yourself.
  How to install:
  a) Rename any scripts you have changed to make sure you have backups! Always be prepaired to go back if something doesn't work like you want it to.
  b) Place all of the files in the module folder of this zip into your server's module folder.
  c) If you renamed all of your files you should NOT replace any files when adding my files to the module.
  d) If you changed the original files and your monsters are using the original AI script names then you can compile your module and test.
  e) If you changed the names of your monsters event files you can do the following:
      1) Rename the new creature event scripts to match the names of the event scripts you changed on your monsters. 
      This is easier than changing the names of the events on each monster in your module!
      See "Renaming Monster Event Scripts" below.
  f) Place the prc_peps.hak into the hak order of the module.
  g) Either place 0e_onclientload in the OnClientEnter event or add the code from this script to your OnClientEnter script.
  h) Compile your module and test.

********** Method #3 **********
This method can be used if you are using the default Bioware AI scripts and have not changed anything in those AI scripts and you do not want to add these files to your module.
  * This is a good way to test the AI and systems to see if you want to add them to your server.
  * This is a clean way to not add more script files to your server and you are fine with the default settings.
  How to Install:
  a) Place all of the files in the override folder of this zip into your servers override folder.
  b) Load your server and test.

****************************************************
********** Renaming Monster Event Scripts **********
****************************************************
For example you are using 0e_c2_onblocked then you would change my script nw_c2_defaulte to 0e_c2_onblocked.
Repeat for each of the following Creature events.
  OnBlocked event: nw_c2_defaulte 
  OnCombatRoundEnd: nw_c2_default3
  OnConversation: nw_c2_default4
  OnDamaged: nw_c2_default6
  OnDeath: Not overwritten by Philos' AI. 
    I do change the script used but it calls the original script that was set on the monster.
    This way you can define special effects when a creature dies without having to worry about the AI.
  OnDisturbed: nw_c2_default8
  OnHeartbeat: nw_c2_default1
  OnPerception: nw_c2_default2
  OnPhysicalAttacked: nw_c2_default5
  OnRested: Not overwritten by Philos' AI.
  OnSpawn: Not overwritten by Philos AI. 
    I leave this open so the builders can do special effects without having to worry about the AI.
    There is an example script if you would prefer to setup here instead of in the heartbeat.
  OnSpellCastAt: nw_c2_defaultb
  OnUserDefined: Not overwritten by Philos AI. 

******************************************************
********** Renaming Associate Event Scripts **********
******************************************************
For example you are using 0e_ch_onblocked then you would change my script nw_ch_ace to 0e_ch_onblocked.
Repeat for each of the following Creature events.
  OnBlocked event: nw_ch_ace 
  OnCombatRoundEnd: nw_ch_ac3
  OnConversation: nw_ch_ac4
  OnDamaged: nw_ch_ac6
  OnDeath: Not overwritten by Philos' AI. 
    I do change the script used but it calls the original script that was set on the monster.
    This way you can define special effects when a creature dies without having to worry about the AI.
  OnDisturbed: nw_ch_ac8
  OnHeartbeat: nw_ch_ac1
  OnPerception: nw_ch_ac2
  OnPhysicalAttacked: nw_ch_ac5
  OnRested: nw_ch_aca
  OnSpawn: Not overwritten by Philos AI. 
    I leave this open so the builders can do special effects without having to worry about the AI.
    There is an example script if you would prefer to setup here instead of in the heartbeat.
  OnSpellCastAt: nw_ch_acb
  OnUserDefined: Not overwritten by Philos AI. 

************************************************************
********** Making sure the Auto Loot system works **********
************************************************************
When testing if the auto loot system does not trigger your loot scripts, you might need to add the following code.
// ********************* ADD AI CODE FOR LOOTING *******************************
// *************** SHOULD NOT CHANGE ORIGINAL BEHAVIOR *************************
    object oPC = GetLocalObject(OBJECT_SELF, "AI_GET_LAST_OPENED_BY");
    if(GetIsObjectValid(oPC)) oLastOpener = oPC;
// ********************* ADD AI CODE FOR LOOTING *******************************
oLastOpener is what is used in the Original campaign to call the treasure scripts. 
If you are dependent on the player to be the opener of your chests then you need to get the PC when a henchmen loots the chest. 
I do that by setting the variable "AI_GET_LAST_OPENED_BY" on the chest to the PC that way you can get the PC even when 
your chests are opened by a henchmen.
