This is a plugin that allows the player to cast defensive spells on themselves and save them to be cast later with the push of one button.
The spells will also cast in a fraction of the time normal spells cast.

********** Features **********
Saves spells that you want to cast often usually after resting without having to cast each spell.
The spells will also cast faster than normal casting.
The spells saved will be saved in the order the player cast them on themselves.
