Philos' AI for Associates version 0.1

This is the read me document for Philos' AI for Associates. It goes over how to install and use the AI for builders making a module or persistant world that want to add a new AI for associates. This includes any creatures under the influence of the player such as henchman, familiars, animal companions.

Bioware - We build upon the shoulders of giants!
Beemdog - I never would have thought it could get better, but it did!
clippy, Daz, Jasperre, Liareth, niv, shadguy, Soren, Squatting Monk, tinygiant, virusman - Keep up the great work!
Special thanks to Jasperre - This project would not be as good as it is without the work on the spell scripts and other AI type improvements within the core game. 

Finally thank you to those who have added to this project.
Demoix - For testing and putting up with the issues and giving detailed feedback! 
********** Description **********
These scripts will replace the original neverwinter nights AI for associates.
This folder holds a compiled (ncs) and text (nss) version of the files with the dialogs and a 2da files needed to use.

********** Installation **********
* Must be running version v89.8193.37-3 of the game and toolset 1.89.
* These scripts will replace the original neverwinter nights ai for associates by changing the event scripts 
  from the defaults to the new AI.
* Associates should be using the nw_ch_ac* event scripts for this to work. The OnSpawn and OnDeath scripts can be anything you want.
* The only overlapping scripts should be nw_ch_summon_9, nw_ch_ac1, nw_g_animal.dlg, nw_g_fam.dlg.
* If you have not changed any of these scripts and are using the defaults you can just add them to the module.
* If you have these scripts in your module just rename them (for safe keeping) and then replace with the above scripts.
* Place all the other files in your module and they should NOT overwrite any scripts.
* The files all start with 0c_ conversation scripts, 0e_ execution scripts, 0i_ include scripts, ai_ ai scripts used by monstres
  and ai_a_ ai scripts use by associates.
* .dlg files should be in a hak or the override folder. 
* ai_spells.2da should be in a hak or the override folder. If the scripts cannot find this 2da THEY WILL NOT WORK. 
     ai_spells.2da allows the talent system to categorize a creatures spells so it can cast effectively. 
     It is also used to decide which creatures should be targeted based on immunities, saves, and resistances. 
     It also defines how a henchman should buff up. VERY IMPORTANT for the AI!
     If you have new spells or abilities these can be added to the ai_spells.2da just like any spell is added to the spells.2da

********** Using and testing in Override **********
* If you just want use or test the AI out you can put the precompiled scripts into the override folder with the Dialogs and ai_spells.2da
  in your module you just need to rename nw_ch_ac1 in the module to something else for safe keeping. 
  This allows my scripts to run and setup your creatures for the new AI.

********** Fully integrating the AI into a server **********
If you decide to use the Philos AI you can fully integrate it by changing the script names of the creature events;
    For example most associates use 0e_ch_ac1 as the heartbeat script in your module.
    Then you would want to change 0e_ch_1_hb to 0e_ch_ac1 as the heartbeat script in your module.
    I have also written OnSpawn and OnDeath event scripts for monsters and associates that can be used as well or checked as an example.

* Associates can be instructed to not speak unless spoken to.
* Saves all conversation changes to the player so each summons will use the ones the last summons did etc.

There are also constants that can be adjusted to make the AI more customized for your module.
These are found in 0i_constants.nss file at the top if you change any of them you must recompile it all.

********** How it works **********
For now this will be a basic understanding of how it works and I will hopefully flesh it out more as time goes on.

A) Setting up a creature just requires the heartbeat script to be defined as nw_c2_default1 for monsters 
   This script cannot be saved to the module, rename it if it is.
B) The AI will "hijack" the heartbeat script and setup the creatures event scripts for the AI so it can detect and attack.
   These creatures event scripts should be the original scripts.
C) Once a creatures OnPerception script fires and they "hear" an enemy it will enter combat mode and begin searching for the enemy.
D) Once a creatures OnPerception script fires and they "see" an enemy then it will do the following;
   1) It sets up a talent array with any spells, special abilities, and items that it can use in combat.
   2) It sets up a combat state for each creature giving them information about each enemy and ally in the battle.
      such as distance, health, combat rating, if they are disabled, and if they can see them for each combat round.
   3) With the combat state and talent array it goes through a script set on the creature based on its class to determine its action.
   4) Once the action has finished it will start at #2 doing each turn until all enemies are dead.
