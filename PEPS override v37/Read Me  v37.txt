Philos' Enhancing Player System (PEPS) is a collection of menus and systems to enhance the single player game.
***** What it does *****
* Replaces the original Neverwinter Nights AI for monsters and associates.
* Adds a widget that allows the player to control their associates.
* Adds options to change how the game is played.
* Adds enhancements to the player's character by allowing them to auto fight, auto buff, and aut loot.

********** !!!WARNING!!! **********
As with all scripting mods for single player it should be understood that once you start a game and save the game while using ANY scripting mod there is a good chance that the game can only be continued using the same mods! 
PEPS is no different and if you add it to a current game MAKE A BACKUP! 
Once you save a game that is using PEPS that game will most likely require PEPS to continue.

***** Installation *****
Option #1) User patch:
* Must be running version 37.15 of Neverwinter Nights Enhanced edition.
* Add the peps.hak to your patch folder.
* Change the userpatch file to the following:
PatchFileXXX=peps where XXX is the next number in the patch sequence.

Option #2) Use the override folder:
* Add the files from the zip to the documents override folder.
* Default location for the override folder is Documents/Neverwinter Nights/override

***** Development folder *****
WARNING: Do not leave files in the development folder unless you are using them!
 This will cause issues and break the game if not used properly.

Read the file PEPS compatibility.pdf for information on how to make a module compatible with PEPS.

***** Starting PEPS *****
There are three ways you can start the PEPS widget once a Neverwinter Nights module has been started or a save game is loaded.
1) Normally it will load on its own using the default.ncs file.
     Sometimes other mod files will use the default.ncs file and thus it will not work. In this case use the other methods below.
2) Use a horse feat. 
	* Use any horse feat on your character.
	I have added PEPS startup scripts to the horse code that will run the PEPS widget and still allow you to use the horse feats. 
3) Run peps.ncs from the debug menu.
	* Once in a game load up the debug menu by pressing [Ctrl + Shift + F12] at the same time.
	* Select NWScript to pull up the NWScript menu.
	* Type peps in the Run Script box at the bottom and hit the Execute button to the right.

If you are using PRC then you will have to use option 2 or 3 to start PEPS as the PRC uses the default script!

***** RULES OPTIONS *****
These features can cause some modules to break. This is happens because to use these features the mod has to recreate the monster and sometimes a module will break if it keeps track of creatures spawned. Example: Infinite Dungeons monster minions will not work using this feature.
* Monsters can summon companions.
* Monster perception: Default. [Monster's default values]
* Make enemy corpses remain.
